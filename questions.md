1. What are the key features of the application? Are these clearly separated into their own files, classes, and/or modules?
    - create histogram from a list of words
    - generate sentences by using histogram

2. Are the names of files, modules, functions, and variables appropriate and accurate? Would a new programmer be able to understand the names without too much contextual knowledge?
    - yes

3. What are the scopes of variables and are they appropriate for their use case? If there are global variables, why are they needed?
    - There are global variables because I need to use them in multiple functions.

4. Are the functions small and clearly specified, with as few side effects as possible?
    - yes, one function has one responsibility.

5. Are there functions that could be better organized in an Object-Oriented Programming style by defining them as methods of a class?
    - yes, histogram
